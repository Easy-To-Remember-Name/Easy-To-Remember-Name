# 👋 Hi, I'm Alt

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m someone who loves to explore how systems work under the hood. I enjoy building things from scratch, tweaking systems, and experimenting with code just for the sake of learning and curiosity.

## 🧩 Hobbies & Explorations

- 🐧 **Linux Tinkering** – Customizing Arch Linux, configuring minimal setups, and experimenting with system-level tweaks.
- 🧠 **Understanding OS Internals** – Bootloaders, kernels, file systems—breaking things to learn how they work.
- 🎮 **Game Dev Experiments** – Making small 2D games with Python and Pygame for fun and learning.
- 💻 **Terminal Fun** – Writing scripts, optimizing shell workflows, and customizing the Fish shell environment.
- 🌐 **Building Useful Tools** – Things like an personal AI assitant present directly on my laptop and automation scripts that scratch a personal itch.
