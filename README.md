# 👋 Hi, I'm Alt

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m someone who loves exploring how systems work under the hood. I enjoy building things from scratch, tweaking systems, and experimenting with code purely out of curiosity and a desire to learn.

## 🧩 Hobbies & Explorations

- 🐧 **Linux Tinkering** – Customizing Arch Linux, configuring minimal setups, and experimenting with low-level system behavior.
- 🧠 **OS Internals** – Bootloaders, kernels, filesystems—breaking and rebuilding things to understand them better.
- 🎮 **Game Dev Experiments** – Making small 2D games with Python and Pygame, just for fun and creativity.
- 💻 **Terminal Fun** – Writing scripts, refining shell workflows, and customizing the Fish shell environment.
- 🌐 **Tool Building** – Creating things like a personal AI assistant that runs directly on my laptop, and automation tools that solve real annoyances.
